Variables will teach us how to store values for later use:
x = 5
Loops will allow us to do some math on every value in a list:
print(item) for item in ['milk', 'eggs', 'cheese']
Conditionals will let us run code if some test is true:
"Our test is true!" if 1 < 2 else "Our test is false!"
Math Operators allow us to perform mathematical operations on numbers
5 + 5 # 10
5 - 5 # 0
5 * 5 # 25
5 / 5 # 1
